## About

You can’t speak the truth unless you are shown the truth.

Right now, indictos is made for people to watch 'Bulbule'. But in future we have different plans for this website if we get good response.

Be a part of the change as Indictos hopes to change the way movie industry works.

Your time is precious and now there are huge number of movies coming out on OTT platforms which makes you confuse what to watch and what to ignore and most of the times, you end up watching a bad or a mediocre movie and you feel like you could have watched something better.

Take the power in your hands and decide what you wanna see rather than few people from the industry industry deciding for yourself what you should watch.

Indictos is a platform where you decide if a movie is worth making or not. You can go through the concepts and synopsis of the given movie ideas to decide which concept is better and whether you think the concept or the story is good enough to be made. And then you can become a part of them by contacting us.

The movie industry keeps shouting Secularism and freedom of thought and expression. But only in words !

In my experience there is no room for the alternate view in the industry even if balanced. I want to bring the indic view which goes beyond left and right ideology where we don’t have to look only at western concepts to define and percieve ourselves.

The socio-political films have a deep relevance in a country like India. But instead of reflecting the different realities of the country the whole bollywood and OTT film industry and its ecosystem is determined to hide and censor certain realities which validates the views/questions of the majority community thus killing the freedom of thought and expression.

I, being from a minority sikh community, could rationally and clearly look at the hypocrisy of the industry when it comes to secularism and freedom of expression. I tried initially to be a part of this system thinking that this industry is all about freedom of thought and expression. But it was not at all. The ecosystem has become such that overall, it has become all about sugarcoating, hiding and even lying when it comes to the social and religious issues. They do not fund political religous movies with good content unless it follows certain ideology or they just simply refrain from making such content as they find them to be risky.

This ‘Indictos’ platform of my own is my attempt to have actual freedom of thought and expression and convey new and unrestricted ideas to the people in general. My debut feature film ‘Bulbule- Our bubble of half knowledge’ is the seed of this platform. Hopefully, it would grow into a plant of more people getting attached to it and give fruits of more motivation to us to make such movies and series in future. As the platofrm gets recognition, we can get other good and experienced filmmakers, whom ewe think have really good content but the industry is not allowing them to come out, to put their story out there to the audience on this platform and get the investment.
