## About

You can’t speak the truth unless you are shown the truth.

Be a part of the change as Indictos hopes to change the way movie industry works.
Your time is precious and now there are huge number of movies coming out on OTT platforms which makes you confuse what to watch and what to ignore and most of the times, you end up watching a bad or a medicocre movie and you feel like you could have watched something better.

Take the power in your hands and decide what you wanna see rather than few people from the industry indutsry deciding for yourself what you should watch.

Indictos is a platform where you decide if a movie is worth making or not. You can go through the concepts and synopsis of the given movie ideas to decide which concept is better and whether you think the concept or the story is good enough to be made. And then you invest in your choice!

The movie industry keeps shouting Secularism and freedom of thought and expression. But only in words !
In my experience there is no room for the alternate view in the industry even if balanced. I want to bring the indic view which goes beyond left and right ideology where we don’t have to look only at western concepts to define and percieve ourselves.

The socio-political films have a deep relevance in a country like India. But instead of reflecting the different realities of the country the whole bollywood and OTT film industry and its ecosystem is determined to hide and censor certain realities which validates the views/questions of the majority community thus killing the freedom of thought and expression.

I, being from a minority sikh community, could rationally and clearly look at the hypocrisy of the industry when it comes to secularism and freedom of expression. I tried initially to be a part of this system thinking that this industry is all about freedom of thought and expression. But it was not at all. The ecosystem has become such that overall, it has become all about sugarcoating, hiding and even lying when it comes to the social and religious issues. They do not fund political religous movies with good content unless it follows certain ideology or they just simply refrain from making such content as they find them to be risky.

This ‘Indictos’ platform of my own is my attempt to have actual freedom of thought and expression and convey new and unrestricted ideas to the people in general. My debut feature film ‘Bulbule- Our bubble of half knowledge’ is the seed of this platform. Hopefully, it would grow into a plant of more people getting attached to it and give fruits of more motivation to us to make such movies and series in future. As the platofrm gets recognition, we can get other good and experienced filmmakers, whom ewe think have really good content but the industry is not allowing them to come out, to put their story out there to the audience on this platform and get the investment.

Dont just belive in our words. Watch Bulbule to decide yourself if we have the potential to make good cinema!!

If you like our film Bulbule and see a potential in us, you can be part of our next projects. You can choose from two subjects of ours-

Mandi: This movie is loosely based on the Delhi riots 2020.
Parasitical: It’s a love story based on a social media couple.

The PPT presentation and the video pitch of the movie ideas are given for you to go through and decide.

You can choose which project you want to be a part of.

The movie business is a very interesting one. You have multiple venues to show case your feature film. For example : Movie Theatres, OTT platforms including Indictos, satellite rights(TV) and many other avenues out of India.

This platform 'Indictos' is expected to change many norms in the movie industry where only certain big names and productions houses and OTT platforms control almost everything from content to distribution. Because of the power in these few hands, you see lot of movies which are really bad or at best, average and mediocre but come out huge in number. You would rarely see a good movie or webseries in whatever limited time you have. You are paying subscription fees for huge number of movies on OTT platforms but you can decide yourself how many of them you really like or love.

Moreover, the movies with political and social content made in the industry is made in just one way which follows only one ideology and alternate views are not allowed which reflects reality with more grains of truth in it.
Indictos hopes to change it with involving general people and cinema loving audience in deciding if the movie or the concept is worth making or not. You decide it and invest in it.

After watching Bulbule for which you you have to pay pay Rs99 , you decide if the next part of the movie should be made or not. If you trust our storytelling and passion, be a part of it yourself.

## HOW THIS WORKS for future movies:

The next project cost is Rs 1.5 crore. It is made up of 15000 indicto coins which means every indicto coin is 1000 rupees. Among these coins 7500 indictos coins are with the creators and the rest 7500 are for people to buy or invest in and then you can earn out of profits with respect to the number of indicto coins you buy or invest in. The profit the movie makes will be divided into investors in accordance with the number of indicto coins they have bought or invested in.For example; When you buy 15 indicto coins , it means you invested Rs 15000, as every indicto coin is worth 1000 rupees. The movie making cost is 1.5 Cr. So your share in the profit would be 15000/15000000 \*100 = 0.1 %

If the investment required for the movie doesn't reach its target within 6 months, the investment you put will be given back to you. The ones investing more than Rs 10 lakhs or the ones buying more than 1000 coins would be named as a co producer in the movie.
The final say about the content and its making and distribution will be in the hands of the creators of the film.

If you want to just donate some amount for our next project or for our passion in general, you can do the same.

If you want to be a part of our project as an investor, then you can buy indicto coins as per your interest and capabillity. As mentioned before, Each indicto coin is worth Rs 1000.
The ones in India would pay Rs.99 for the movie and the ones outside india would have to pay 3 dollars.
