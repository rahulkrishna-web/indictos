**Q: Why something like indicto platform should be there ?**

A: To involve the general movie lovers in the decision making. Your time is precious and now there are huge number of movies/series coming out on OTT platforms which makes you confuse what to watch and what to ignore and most of the times, you end up watching a bad or a medicocre movie and you feel like you could have watched something better.

Take the power in your hands and decide what you wanna see rather than few people from the industry indutsry deciding for yourself what you should watch.

Indictos is a platform where you decide if a movie is worth making or not. You can go through the concept and synopsis of the movie to decide whether you think the concept or the story is good enough to be made and then invest in it

**Q: Why should you not go through the typical system of bollywood and OTT platforms?**

A: Because they kill creativity and they try to strangle your ideas.

For example: The movie industry keeps shouting Secularism and freedom of thought and expression. But only in words !

In my experiecne there is no room for the alternate view even if balanced. I want to bring the indic view which goes beyond left and right ideology where we don’t have to look only at western concepts to define and percieve ourselves.

The socio-political films have a deep relevance in a country like India. But instead of reflecting the different realities of the country the whole bollywood and OTT film industry and its ecosystem is determined to hide and censor certain realities which validates the views/questions of the majority community thus killing the freedom of thought and expression.

I, being from a minority sikh community, could rationally and clearly look at the hypocrisy of the industry when it comes to secularism and freedom of expression. I tried initially to be a part of this system thinking that this industry is all about freedom of thought and expression. But it was not at all. The ecosystem has become such that overall, it has become all about sugarcoating, hiding and even lying when it comes to the social and religious issues. They do not fund political religous movies with good content unless it follows certain ideology or they just simply refrain from making such content as they find them to be risky.

This ‘Indictos’ platform of my own is my attempt to have actual freedom of thought and expression and convey new and unrestricted ideas to the people in general. My debut feature film ‘Bulbule- Our bubble of half knowledge’ is the seed of this platform. Hopefully, it would grow into a plant of more people getting attached to it and give fruits of more motivation to us to make such movies and series in future.

**Q: Will it show certain people to be villian and certain kind of people to be hero?**

A: No! People are of complex nature and attributes to be defined in one bracket. So do not expect a propaganda kind of movie.

**Q: What will I gain if I want to buy lot of indicto coins ?**

A: You can buy as many as possible till 5000 coins. But if you buy more than 700 coins, which is equal to Rs 10.5 lakh, your name will be included in the co producer list.

**Q: Can non resident indians or the ones outside india can invest?**

A: Sure. Go ahead!

**Q: What if the movie invetsment target is not reached ?**

A: We will wait for 6 months to see if we get the investement or not. If we are not able to reach our target withing 6 months, the money you invested in indicto coins will be returned back to you.

**Q: How much time would you take to finish the movie?**

A: As soon as we reach our target of investment, we should be able to finish the movie in 6-9 months.

**Q: Will there be some known actors in your next project?**

A: Yes, we will surely try to rope some decently known faces. But if some actor with a big enough name comes on board after reading the script, then more money would be reuqired to rope that actor in. And if we get that extra investment in his name from somwhere, that will change the cost of the movie and thus your share in the movie proect would change accordingly with respect to the indicto coins you have invested in

**Q: What are the profits**

**Q: Will I have any say in the creating process of the movie if i become the co producer or buy indicto coins?**

A: We are always open to new and intersting ideas! You can always share your ideas with the creators as it can be helpful and we welcome that. But please trust the creators for making a decision as they are more well versed with the nuances of story telling and the vision of the movie. And as its said, too many cooks spoil the dish. But you can always send your ideas as we never know what really takes our movie to next level.

**Q: Where can I send my ideas for your next movie ‘Bulbule, part-2’ if i have any?**

A: indictos136@gmail.com, manpreet@indictos.com
